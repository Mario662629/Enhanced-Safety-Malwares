pcigdvvibp.exe by pankoza

Short C++ GDI Malware
This is very dangerous for the non-safety version, the non-safety version will damage the MBR and make the PC unusable
Both versions contain flashing lights and loud sounds, so it's not for people with epilepsy!
I'm not responsible for any damages.

This is probably my last malware (or is it?)
