Ethylenediaminetetraacetate.exe by pankoza
I know I said APM 08279+5255.exe would be my last GDI Malware, but I made another one just to Celebrate new year 2024 (Man I can't believe 2014 was 10 years ago!, which means Windows 8.1 will be 11 years old this year!)
Works on Windows XP-11 (but XP is recommended)
The non-safety version will destroy your PC when you run it, I'm not responsible for any damages, because this malware was created for educational purposes only!

Creation time December 31 2023 - January 1 2024
As always this malware contains flashing lights and earrape, not for epilepsy
If you want to run it on Windows XP/Server 2003 x64 Edition, then use the x64 version or it won't set itself as critical process
This is probably my last malware for real this time
