C++ HSL GDI Malware
Made for Educational Purposes Only, I'm NOT Responsible for ANY Damages!
Works in Windows XP-11
This is very dangerous for the non-safety version
The non-safety version will damage the MBR and make the PC unusable
It's recommended to run it in a Virtual Machine that was snapshotted or Fully Cloned before
If you can't use a Virtual Machine, then run the Safety version
And if you have Epilepsy, then don't even watch videos about it!
