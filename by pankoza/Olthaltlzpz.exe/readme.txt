Olthaltlzpz.exe by pankoza

C++ GDI Malware
This is very dangerous for the non-safety version, the non-safety version will damage the MBR, registry and make the PC unusable
on Windows Vista and newer it will also corrupt Boot\BCD
Works on Windows XP-11 but especially well on XP, Vista and 7
Both versions contain flashing lights and loud sounds, so it's not for people with epilepsy!
I'm not responsible for any damages.

I managed to make a comeback and will probably keep making malwares until the end of this year in my free time

Thanks to fr4ctalz for helping with some payloads

Bugs: bytebeat might stop on Windows XP halfway through the payloads






















fun fact: olthaltlzpz is a Caesar Cipher for Hematemesis (a vomiting of blood)
