ksdcbrctys.exe by pankoza
This is a Malware
Works in Windows XP - 11
I'm not responsible for any damages
This is very dangerous for the non-safety version
The non-safety version will damage the MBR and make the PC Unusable
but the SAFETY version is safe to run on real PC
If you have epilepsy, then avoid this malware totally
