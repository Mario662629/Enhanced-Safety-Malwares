xjmjivqdmpn.exe by pankoza

Finally, a 20 payload malware
This is very dangerous for the non-safety version, the non-safety version will damage the MBR, delete the user account and the registry and make the PC unusable
on Windows Vista and newer it will also corrupt Boot\BCD
Works on Windows XP-11 but especially well on XP, Vista and 7
Both versions contain flashing lights and loud sounds, so it's not for people with epilepsy, that's why even the safety version has execution warnings!
As always this was created for educational purposes only. I'm not responsible for any damages and misuse of this malicious software for evil purposes by others, This malware displays 2 warning message boxes to prevent many accidents from happening!

Thanks to fr4ctalz for the base for some HSL shaders and for some bytebeats and shader
Thanks to N17Pro3426 for the RndRGB (used only in one shader tho) and the radius
I recommend you to use a wallpaper that doesn't consist mostly of white and/or black color, because otherwise you won't see the HSL Shaders well
